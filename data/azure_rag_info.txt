Azure Cognitive Search RAG Implementation

This document explains how to implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Azure Cognitive Search and Azure OpenAI.

## Overview
RAG combines the power of large language models with external knowledge retrieval to provide more accurate and contextual responses. The system works by:

1. Indexing documents into Azure Cognitive Search with vector embeddings
2. Converting user queries to embeddings for similarity search
3. Retrieving relevant document chunks
4. Using retrieved context to generate responses with Azure OpenAI

## Key Components

### Azure Cognitive Search
- Stores document chunks with vector embeddings
- Performs vector similarity search
- Returns most relevant content based on query embeddings

### Azure OpenAI
- Generates embeddings for documents and queries
- Provides chat completion with retrieved context
- Ensures responses are grounded in the indexed knowledge

### Vector Search
- Uses HNSW algorithm for efficient similarity search
- Supports cosine similarity for semantic matching
- Configurable parameters for search quality vs speed

## Implementation Benefits
- Accurate responses based on your specific data
- Reduced hallucination compared to raw LLM responses
- Scalable to large document collections
- Real-time query processing with sub-second response times

## Best Practices
- Chunk documents appropriately (500-1000 characters)
- Use overlapping chunks to maintain context
- Regular index updates for new content
- Monitor search quality and adjust parameters as needed
